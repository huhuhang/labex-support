# XP, Levels and Badges üéñÔ∏è

At LabEx, we're excited to introduce three features designed to reward your hard work and encourage hands-on learning: Badges, Levels, and Experience Points (XP). Our goal is to inspire you to continuously improve your skills through practical exercises, aligning with our core principle of "Learn by Doing."

Remember: XP, Levels, and Badges aren't the end goal. The aim is to actively practice and gain more Skills on the Skill Trees.

## Experience Points (XP)

XP is a measure of the knowledge you've gained through completing Labs at LabEx. For every new Skill acquired on a Skill Tree, you earn 10 XP. This not only signifies your mastery over that skill but also pushes you further on your learning journey.

## Levels

At LabEx, your journey begins at Level 1. Your Level is displayed next to your avatar, and it increases every time you earn 200 XP.

Our Level system comprises four tiers:

- **Grey Tier**: Level 1-4 (0-799 XP)
- **Blue Tier**: Level 5-19 (800-3799 XP)
- **Red Tier**: Level 20-49 (3800-9799 XP)
- **Purple Tier**: Level 50+ (9800+ XP)

For example, to reach Level 5 (Blue Tier), you need to acquire 80 Skills (800 XP).

## Badges

Badges are unique rewards that showcase your learning achievements. We've designed three categories of badges:

1. **Lab Badges:** These badges are awarded based on the number of Labs you've completed.

   - **First Lab Conqueror** - This badge will signify the completion of the first lab, marking your first step in your journey.
   - **Course Pioneer** - This badge is given when you complete your first course, indicating your commitment to learning and the successful completion of a comprehensive set of labs.
   - **Lab Enthusiast** - Awarded after completion of 10 labs, this badge represents your commitment to mastering new skills.
   - **Lab Expert** - After finishing 20 labs, you receive this badge, highlighting your extensive practical experience.
   - **Lab Champion** - This badge is given after 50 labs, showcasing your broad range of hands-on learning experiences.
   - **Lab Master** - This top-level badge is awarded after completing 100 labs, marking you as a true LabEx veteran with an expansive set of skills

2. **XP Badges:** Earn these badges by reaching specific XP milestones (100, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000 XP).
3. **Skill Tree Badges:** Earn a badge by mastering all the Skills on a specific Skill Tree. Note: You don't need to finish all Labs; just gain all the Skills to achieve these badges.
