# LabEx Key Concepts

## What is LabEx?

LabEx is an interactive, hands-on learning platform dedicated to coding and technology. It combines labs, AI assistance, and virtual machines to provide a no-video, practical learning experience.

We use a simple formula to explain LabEx:

## The Uniqueness of LabEx

What sets LabEx apart is its focus on learning through practice rather than watching videos. Features include:

- A strict "Learn by Doing" approach with exclusive hands-on labs and no videos.
- Interactive online environments within the browser, with automated step-by-step checks.
- A structured content organization with the Skill Tree based learning system.
- A growing learning resource of 30 Skill Trees and over 6,000 Labs.
- The AI learning assistant Labby, built on ChatGPT, providing a conversational learning experience.

## What is Skill Tree?

Systematic and personalized learning is the key to learning. LabEx provides Skill Trees for users to learn systematically and efficiently.

Skill Tree is LabEx's resource skeleton, linking different challenges and labs. Skill Tree is officially defined based on the technical direction, and We will keep up to date with the latest Skill Tree.

When you join a skill tree and learn labs and challenges, the associated skill points will be illuminated.

## What is Labs?

Labs are the core of LabEx, offering interactive, pre-configured, sandbox-style development environments accompanied by guided tutorials, each of which includes checks to ensure the accuracy of your actions.

There are three types of labs:

- **Basic Labs:** Foundation units teaching step-by-step skills.
- **Challenges:** A Challenge is a problem or task designed to test your skills in a specific area.
- **Projects:** Real-world projects guided by Labby, suitable for applying and deepening learned skills.

Labby provides detailed step-by-step guidance throughout the process. Usually, beginners start with basic labs, consolidate their skills through challenges, and then apply and learn further through projects.

## Courses in LabEx

A course is a collection of labs. Users complete the labs in the course in sequence to learn and acquire the targeted skills of the course. Some courses offer certificates upon completion for LabEx Pro members.

Project courses are a set of project type labs. Users complete multiple labs in sequence to finish the entire project. Project courses are typically chosen for practical exercises after users have acquired basic skills.

## Verification of Lab Steps

Each lab contains several steps. When a user completes a step and clicks the continue button, the system automatically runs a verification script associated with that step in the lab virtual machine. This checks the user's code and environment or services, determining whether the step is completed. If not, it provides feedback for further refinement.

## What is Cloud Lab?

Cloud Lab refers to Alibaba Cloud Lab, which offers a different experience from other labs. Instead of a Linux VM, users receive credentials to log into the Alibaba Cloud management console and perform operations based on the lab instructions. Note that due to cost, Cloud Lab is not included in the LabEx Pro subscription and requires purchasing credits or using vouchers.
