## What You'll Gain

Every completed [Skill Tree](key-concepts#what-is-skill-tree) is more than just a learning milestone; itâ€™s a step towards a greener earth.

You earn a new skill tree and a real tree planted for you. Plus, youâ€™ll receive a certificate from One Tree Planted in recognition of your contribution. Your dedication to learning not only betters yourself but also our planet.
