Completing a lab or challenge illuminates the corresponding skills, and lighting up the entire Skill Tree indicates proficiency in that area.

## Quick Start Guide

Starting a lab is simple:

1. **Select a Lab:** Choose a lab of interest and click `Start`.
2. **Lab Environment:** Click on **Default VM** to enter the lab environment.
