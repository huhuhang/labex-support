# Starting Your First Lab in LabEx

## Discovering Featured Courses

Each Skill Tree includes a 'Featured Courses' section with recommended foundational courses. These are typically the starting point for learners new to a Skill Tree.

## Engaging in Free Learning Mode

Below the featured courses, you'll find all the labs and challenges related to the Skill Tree. You can choose any skill to learn at your own pace.

Completing a lab or challenge illuminates the corresponding skills, and lighting up the entire Skill Tree indicates proficiency in that area.

## Quick Start Guide

Starting a lab is simple:

1. **Select a Lab:** Choose a lab of interest and click `Start`.
2. **Lab Environment:** Click on **Default VM** to enter the lab environment.

A virtual desktop is automatically created for your lab session. It may take a few seconds to load.
