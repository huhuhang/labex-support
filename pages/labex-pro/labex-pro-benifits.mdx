# Benefits of LabEx Pro

## Benefits

LabEx Pro subscribers have access to an extensive range of features. Please note that Cloud Lab is not included in these benefits:

- **6000+ Hands-On Labs**
- **2000+ Challenge Solutions** 
- **50+ Real-World Projects** 
- **Certificates of Completion** 
- **Unlimited Temporary VMs and 2 Persistent VMs**
- **Unlimited-Resource Pro Cluster** 
- **Full Access to Labby AI Assistant** 

## What does "Unlimited Temporary VMs and 2 Persistent VMs" mean?

- **Unlimited Temporary VMs:** Pro users can launch any number of VMs in non-Cloud Lab labs without restrictions, unlike the free plan, which limits to 5 launches per day.
- **2 Persistent VMs:** Pro users can save two temporary VMs for up to 30 days, allowing continuation of projects or labs from where they left off.

## What does "Unlimited-Resource Pro Cluster" mean?

While free plan users operate on a shared cluster which may face resource shortages, Pro users will not encounter such issues as they are allocated to a dedicated Pro cluster with ample resources.
