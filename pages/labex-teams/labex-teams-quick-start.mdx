# LabEx Teams Quick Start Guide

## Introduction to LabEx Teams

Dive into LabEx Teams â€” our premium offering designed especially for businesses and educational entities. By integrating 'Learn by Doing' and 'Skill Tree Based Learning', LabEx Teams introduces tools like team management and learning progress tracking, paving the way for effective team learning.

This guide will walk team admins through the essentials: setting up a vibrant learning community, designating skill trees, and keeping an eye on individual progress.


## Key Concepts

* **LabEx Teams Admin & Member**: The Admin oversees team learning management, while Members are learners added to the team.

* **Group**: A Group organizes Members into specific cohorts, such as 'Dev Team' or 'Test Team', for targeted learning and easy management.

* **Lab**: The fundamental learning unit, each Lab addresses particular Skills and falls under the corresponding Skill Tree. By actively engaging in Labs on the LabEx platform, learners can acquire and master these Skills.

* **Skills**: Specific competencies that users aim to master within a Skill Tree. By completing labs, members acquire these skills, marking their progression through the Skill Tree.

* **Skill Tree**: A structured learning pathway comprised of various Skills in a specific domain. By adding a Skill Tree to LabEx Teams and assigning it to a Group, you guide the learning journey of Members within that Group.


## Payment Methods and Pricing

LabEx Teams offers two payment methods catering to different needs:

1. **Pro Access for Members (Excluding Cloud Labs):**
   - Under this plan, each team member gets Pro access to all experiments except Cloud Labs.
   - **Pricing:** The annual cost per seat is $118.8, with a minimum subscription for five seats.

2. **Cloud Labs Access (Pay-Per-Credit):**
   - If your team only requires Alibab Cloud Labs, you pay per credit.
   - **Credit Pool:** A team can share a common credit pool. The Team Admin can manage this pool as needed.
   - **User Limit:** Under this plan, a team can have up to 100 users.

These flexible pricing options allow teams to choose the most suitable plan based on their specific requirements and the size of their team.
